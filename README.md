# üöÄ Mastering Multidimensional Arrays in C++ üöÄ

Welcome to this repository! This project is a deep dive into the world of multidimensional arrays, using C++ to demonstrate fundamental concepts and operations.

If you've ever wondered how to handle data in a grid-like structure ‚Äî like a spreadsheet, game board, or image ‚Äî you're in the right place!

## ü§î What Are Multidimensional Arrays?

Think of a regular array as a **single list of items**, like a to-do list.  
A **multidimensional array** is like an *array of arrays*.  

- **1D Array** ‚Üí `arr[i]`
- **2D Array** ‚Üí `grid[row][column]`

A 2D array is perfect for representing **tables, grids, matrices**, and more.

## üíª Code Files and Explanations

| File        | Purpose | Core Logic |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| **exp8a.cc** | Initializes a 3√ó3 matrix, takes user input, and displays it | Nested `for` loops for row-column traversal |
| **exp8b.cc** | Adds two matrices of the same size | `result[i][j] = m1[i][j] + m2[i][j]` |
| **exp8c.cc** | Multiplies two matrices (if cols of first == rows of second) | Three nested loops, dot product calculation |
| **exp8d.cc** | Sums elements on the main diagonal of a square matrix | `sum += matrix[i][i]` in a single loop |
| **exp8e.cc** | Computes the transpose of a matrix | Swap indices: `transpose[j][i] = matrix[i][j]` |
| **exp8f.cc** | Checks if a matrix is symmetric | Compare `matrix[i][j]` with `matrix[j][i]` |

## üåê Real-World Applications

- **Matrix Input/Output (exp8a.cc)**: Building block for calculators, data entry tools.
- **Matrix Addition (exp8b.cc)**: Image blending, brightening, combining vector fields.
- **Matrix Multiplication (exp8c.cc)**: Computer graphics (rotation, scaling), machine learning, simulations.
- **Sum of Diagonal (exp8d.cc)**: Trace of a matrix, important in linear algebra proofs.
- **Matrix Transpose (exp8e.cc)**: Solving equations, covariance matrices, data transformations.
- **Symmetric Matrix Check (exp8f.cc)**: Physics (moment of inertia tensor), graph theory (undirected graphs).
